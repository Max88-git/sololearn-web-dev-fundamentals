  // Let
  // Variables are containers for storing values.
  // Variables are created using the let keyword.
  let name;
  // After creating the variable, we can initialize it with a value.
  // The equal sign is used to assign a value to our variable.
  name = 'James';
  // We can also assign our variable a value during creation.
  let name = 'James';
  let age = 42;
  // After initializing a variable, we can output its value.
  let name = 'James';
  console.log(name);
  // Variables can change their value during the program.
  let age = 42;
  // Updating the value of a variable can be done as many times as needed.
  age = 24;
  console.log(age);
  // In older versions of JavaScript, the var keyword was used instead of let, to declare variables.
  var name = 'James';
  // let is the modern way of declaring variables and has a number of advantages over var.
  // Constants
  // Constants are similar to variables and are declared using the const keyword
  const color = 'red';
  console.log(color);
  // Constants must have a value when declared and they cannot change their value.
