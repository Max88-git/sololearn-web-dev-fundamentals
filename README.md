## Overview

### The course

The goal of this course is to provide learners with the essential skill set needed to build dynamic and responsive websites for themselves and potential clients. With this course, I learnt the structure, philosophies, and best practices being used by experienced web developers around the world today.

- The first step to learning web development, like anything with programming, is learning the basics. This means exploring the different types of web development that exist, and the fundamental principles of the pillar languages of modern web development -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- HTML Basics
  - This section delves into the fundamentals of HTML and how it underpins the websites you use on a daily basis.
- CSS Basics
  - Colors, layout, and typefaces are examples of the terminology used to describe the appearance of Web sites. CSS allows users to customize the appearance of a website for multiple devices, such as large displays, tiny screens, and printers.
- JavaScript Basics
  - This section will explain why JavaScript is so good for web development. Learn the fundamentals of the language as well as some of its most used web development applications.

## My process

- It took me 19 days to finish the course. It broke down what I needed to know about web programming into small, "bite-sized" bits, making it simple to keep up with my studies. I spent 1-2 hours per day going through each section, making notes and completing tasks and quizzes along the way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- JavaScript

### What I learnt

- Module 1 - I learnt about the foundational elements of HTML. Text formatting, page structure, attributes and elements.
- Module 2 - Covered more HTML elements like lists, tables, page sections, forms, form controls, multimedia etc.
- Module 3 - I learnt what CSS is used for, CSS selectors, styling text, font styles, the box model, CSS layout, positioning and much more.
- Module 4 - I learnt about JavaScript and why JavaScript is so ideal for web development. It covered variables, basic math, decision making, loops, arrays, functions and event handling.

  Here is a code snippet I am proud of:

```js
// Event Handling
// Output the numbers 1 to 10 in a loop when the button is clicked.
btn.onclick = function () {
  let score = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) console.log(++score);
};
```
